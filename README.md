# Cisco ACI Automation using Python

## Purpose
- Python script repository for simple Cisco ACI automation tasks.
- At this point concentrates on provisioning and "pushing" configuration.
- createOverlay.py is the main script at the moment. It creates a new overlay network and policies attached to that based on configuration database caputered at configuration.json.

## Next steps
- Please note scripts are very much under development at the moment.
- createMSOverlay.py needs to be implemented, since the current script only deals with single site setup.
